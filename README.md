This project implements the interface of a RESTful API Server, compliant with [CSGF APIs][specs] specifications. Any activity processed by this interface will be then processed and orchestrated by the [API Server Daemon][APIServerDaemon] component.

This service offers the same capabilities of the [API Server][APIServer] project with the following differences:
 - It exploits the [CSGF][CSGF]' GridEngine system to target its supported distributed ifnrastructures
 - It may support other executors services just developing the right interface classes into the [API Server Daemon][APIServerDaemon] 

The Principal advantages of this solutions are:

 - Backward compatibility with existing systems based on the CSGF
 - Fast provisioning of ready to go solutions
 - Fast prototyping when designing new features and components (including APIServer itself)
 - Ideal solution for existing development environments already using CSGF
